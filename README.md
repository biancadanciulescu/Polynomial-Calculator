# Polynomial Calculator
This topic aims to implement a polynomial calculator, which will perform the following operations:
- Addition of two polynomials
- Subtraction of two polynomials
- Multiplying two polynomials
- Division of two polynomials
- Derivation of a polynomial
- Integration of a polynomial

To give the user more comfort, I will implement a graphical interface using Java Swing. Among the secondary objectives is the optimal collection of polynomials using a regex. Polynomials have the structure of a HashMap that holds the power of the polynomial at the key position, and the value is represented by the coefficient.
